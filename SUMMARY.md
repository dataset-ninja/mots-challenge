**MOTSChallenge Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and identification tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 2862 images with 111232 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *pedestrian* and *ignore region*.

Images in the MOTSChallenge dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (2862 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence*** tag. Every label contains information about its ***instance id*** and ***object id***. Explore it in Supervisely labelling tool.
